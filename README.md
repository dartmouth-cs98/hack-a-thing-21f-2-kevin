# hack-a-thing-21f-2-kevin

Short description of what you attempted to build:
A decentralized cryptocurrency bank that allows for staking of crypto.

What you learned:
Some basic react.js and full-stack web development using node.js. Improved my ability to write smart contracts using solidity and worked with Web3.js.

How does this hack-a-thing inspire you or relate to your possible project ideas?
I have been able to create a hot wallet that accepts and can send out ERC20 tokens on Ethereum, this can be a MVP for a more complex application.

What didnâ€™t work
Setting up environment and dependencies was difficult due to many different required versions of software such as node.js, ganache, truffle, react.
